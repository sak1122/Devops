installing kubeadm
machine should be linux machine.
1)it should have requirement satisfaction instance t2 madium.
2)it should installed with container runtime eg- containerd,docker,cri-o
3)swapping off (swap area)
4)kubectl
5)kubeadm
6)kubelet	



docker installation
docker can install  ---just simply by get.docker com
docker installtion prette easy good

kubeadm init ---after successfull installation it gives commad to set up masternode and workernode.
--their is sha key that should be saved for further master and worker node configuration

install network-module  ---kubectl install wave network  ---kubectl commaly to manage the nodes 


worker node also need to install all thigs which in rather than kubeadm init

//for controll this node no needs to install all those too only tool like kubectl can manage all nodes
in configuration master admin.conf  copy to controlling user home  ./kube directory as file

now you can controll the nodes


//
kubeadm reset
--it will reset all the components

thier is 4 phases to reset
1)preflight
2)update-clustor-status
3)remove-etdc-member
4)cleanup node

you can skip any of the phase 
kubeadm reset --skip-phases


*kubernates clustor upgrade
we have to take backup before any types of backup into kubernates
/etc/kubernates/manifest
/var/lib/etcd
you can only update the minor version of the kubernates not the major
kubernates itself takes backup of all the files before backup

*kubernates tokens and certificates
way to do secure communication between master and worker nodes
kubeadm token list --to list the token if forget or know again
